## Frontend Terminology Mapping

For consistency in the user interface, use these terms:

**Frontend Display** → **Internal Code**
- Course → Project (variables, functions, database remain as "project")
- Lesson → Session (variables, functions, database remain as "session")

This mapping ensures user-facing terminology is clear and educational while maintaining internal consistency with existing codebase structure.

## Development Guidelines

1. Check if tavily mcp search and extract are available, and if so use them as necessary for research including but not limited to finding the most recent version of documentation.

2. When faced with a decision of two or more ways to do things always think of two or more, up to 4, plausible alternatives. List out their headline, main points (no more than 2 pro and con each), critique the alternatives, then choose the one that the best world class leading expert would choose.
