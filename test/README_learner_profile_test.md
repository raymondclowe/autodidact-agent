# Learner Profile Impact Test

This test suite validates that learner profiles actually impact the generated course material in the Autodidact Agent system.

## Overview

The learner profile system in Autodidact is designed to personalize learning experiences by maintaining:
- **Generic profiles**: General learning preferences across all subjects  
- **Topic-specific profiles**: Learning patterns for particular subjects/projects

This test ensures that these profiles actually result in different teaching content being generated by the AI tutor.

## Test Approach

The test creates two diametrically opposed learner profiles:

### Visual/Hands-on Learner Profile
- Prefers visual and interactive instruction
- Learns best through concrete, real-world examples  
- Strongly prefers hands-on practice over theory
- Fast-paced learning with immediate feedback
- Motivated by building projects and seeing results

### Theoretical/Reflective Learner Profile  
- Prefers theoretical and analytical instruction
- Learns best through abstract principles
- Strongly prefers understanding theory before practice
- Slow and deliberate pacing with time for reflection
- Motivated by deep understanding and elegant solutions

## What the Test Validates

1. **Different Profile Contexts**: The two profiles generate significantly different learner profile contexts
2. **Different Teaching Prompts**: The same course material produces different teaching prompts based on profiles
3. **Different Recap Prompts**: Recap prompts are also personalized by learner profiles
4. **Meaningful Profile Extraction**: Profile information is properly extracted and included in contexts
5. **Topic-Specific Context**: Topic profiles add subject-relevant personalization

## Running the Tests

### Run just the tests:
```bash
cd /path/to/autodidact-agent
PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest test/test_learner_profile_impact.py -v
```

### Run tests with demonstration output:
```bash
cd /path/to/autodidact-agent  
PYTHONPATH=. python test/test_learner_profile_impact.py
```

The demonstration mode shows exactly how the two different profiles create different contexts that would lead to personalized AI tutor responses.

## Test Results

When successful, the test demonstrates that:

- Visual learners get context focused on:
  - Interactive tutorials, coding exercises, visual debuggers
  - Game programming, web development examples
  - Code snippets, flowcharts, visual diagrams
  - Fast-paced activities with immediate feedback

- Theoretical learners get context focused on:
  - Algorithm analysis, concept mapping, theoretical explanations  
  - Computer science algorithms, mathematical applications
  - Formal definitions, mathematical notation
  - Slow, deliberate pacing with time for reflection

## Integration

This test can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that learner profile functionality continues to work as expected when changes are made to the codebase.

The test uses mocking to avoid requiring actual database connections or API calls, making it fast and reliable for automated testing.
