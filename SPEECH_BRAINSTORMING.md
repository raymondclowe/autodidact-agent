- **Scope**: Session content, learning objectives, AI responses, quiz questions
- **Technical**: Web Speech API `speechSynthesis` for broad browser support
- **UX**: Immediate feedback, pausable speech, speed controls

### 2. **Auto-Speech Mode** (Immersive Learning)
- **Trigger**: Toggle switch in session header
- **Behavior**: All AI tutor responses auto-spoken upon generation
- **Intelligence**: Skip repetitive UI elements, focus on educational content
- **User Control**: Pause/resume, skip ahead, adjust speed

### 3. **Voice Input Modes**
#### Basic Voice Input
- **UI**: Click-to-talk button with visual feedback (pulsing mic icon)
- **Flow**: Click ‚Üí Record ‚Üí Stop ‚Üí Transcribe ‚Üí Process

   - Interactive audio tours of visual elements

4. **Lists and Tables**
   - Structured enumeration with clear breaks
   - "Item 1... Item 2... Moving to the next section..."
   - Summary statements before detail

### Content Adaptation Framework
```
Original Text: "See Figure 1.2 below:"
Speech Version: "Let's examine the diagram I've shown on screen..."

Original: "The formula E=mc¬≤ demonstrates..."  
Speech: "The equation E equals m c squared demonstrates..."

Original: "Click 'Next' to continue"
Speech: "When you're ready, proceed to the next section"
```
